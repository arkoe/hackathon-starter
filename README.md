# Hackathon Starter

You can use this Node.js webapp as a starter for your Decentralized Application. It comes with several dependecies (click on their name to go to their website):
 - [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/)
   Express is a light and easy to use Node.js framework. 
 - [**Mongoose (MongoDB)**](http://mongoosejs.com/)
   Mongoose is an elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js. This allows you to easily use a database in your web application.
 - [**jQuery**](http://jquery.com/)
   jQuery is an easy to use JavaScript framework. It makes event handling, DOM manipulation and creating AJAX requests a lot easier.

### Requirements
It is optional to use this repository for your project, but if you use it the main requirement is NodeJS. To install this, you can download the installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download/. After installing, a reboot of your computer is required.

**Testing on Windows**
To see if NodeJS is installed succesfully, open *cmd* (Windows Command Prompt) and type `node -v`. It should show you the version number, for example: v6.10.1.

**Testing on OSX**
To see if NodeJS is installed succesfully, open *terminal*  and type `node -v`. It should show you the version number, for example: v6.10.1.

### Installation
You can either download the zip from this project or clone it using `git` (requires git installation). To clone this repository, use: `git clone https://github.com/arkoe/hackathon-starter.git`.

### Running your web application
To run the web application, open either your `cmd` or `terminal` and navigate the the project. Run the application by typing `node server.js`, you will see a message like this: 
Server listening on port 3000

Then simply open `http://localhost:3000` in your web-browser. In the code is a small example on how to create post requests and sending data.
